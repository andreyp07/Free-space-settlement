# Free-space-settlement
Elaboration of an algorithm capable of printing the characteristics of the feasible free space settlement structure from a series of inputs 
(number of inhabitants, maximum height of building...). An extension should be included to choose the structure that meet the desired needs 
of the user (for instance, minimum total area in order to minimize the number of resources used).
